1. The test is designed to help understand your Front-end Development Skills in HTML / CSS / JS.
2. You are free to use any third-party frameworks or libraries that may be needed to complete these tasks.
3. We expect the output to be responsive and work across different devices.
4. While doing the tasks, use the common UI/UX principles while converting the designs to modern functional pages.
5. There are layouts for 3 different tasks whose designs have been provided as image files. You're expected to do ANY 2 tasks that you like.


TASK 1: 
You are expected to build a responsive template. [Reference image: Task1.jpg]

TASK 2:
It's a 6-step form and you can complete any 4 steps. [Reference images: Task2a.png, Task2b.png, Task2c.png]

TASK 3:
It's a 3-step form and you need to build the first 2. [Reference images: Task3a.png, Task3b.png]


(Choose any 2 of the above)


*** IMPORTANT NOTE ***
These tasks mimic the kind of work you’d be doing on a daily basis while on the job. It is imperative that you follow the academic honor code and complete these tasks on your own, without taking any help from another person. This is essential because this will help us evaluate how successful you’ll be in this role and we’re sure you definitely do not want to signup for a job where you won’t be successful.
